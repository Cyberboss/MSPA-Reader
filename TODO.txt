-- Fix inline link positioning
-- A better inline link solution? (Currently opens browser)
-- Allow horizontal scroll to center comic content if window width is too small.
-- LOWAS in void fireflies
-- Check if it works with older MSPA works(Jailbreak, problem sleuth), if we're lucky it will jst work with the regular style and we can just lower the minimum page cap
-- Implement archive page (Use header link once done)
-- Review password saving code
-- Implement ads taken straight from the website in comic footer, legal? (trying to help out hussie here, and I'm pretty sure they all go to whatpumpkin anyway)
	^ thinking about it, also the sidebar ads too, I don't want hussie losing revenue.
(DONE??? I SERIOUSLY CAN'T TELL) -- Figure out how to load Cascade properly (only multipart flash, as of right now I have no idea how if it's loading from the files or the loader is downloading the rest of the segments).
-- Support for archival and serial reading modes (x.gif vs x_retcon.gif, activate retcon once past a certain page)
-- Better narrative/dialog parsing?
-- Support line breaks in pesterlogs?
(NOT NEEDED?) -- Support fonts via parsing instead of statically
-- Fix pesterlog system message regex?
-- Read through and mark down problem pages
-- Fix problem pages
(DONE? lack of integrity check may make it buggy, no idea how transactions are handled either) -- Support Sqlite
-- Support Oracle (Can I get access to a db for testing?)
-- Better parsing techniques?
(Dismissed as Impossible) -- S̶u̶p̶p̶o̶r̶t̶ ̶V̶r̶i̶s̶k̶a̶
