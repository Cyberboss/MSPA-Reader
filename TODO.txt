Primary: Style sheet support.
Doesn't need to be dynamic, just needs to work

List of known different styles of the top of my head

Regular (DONE)
Scratch (mostly done except for LE alt-text);
Homosuck
Sbahj
Trickster
2x (not so much a different style as two pages next to each other)
Cascade (DONE)
DOTA, (DONE)
SHESBACK (DONE)
Caliborn's page smash (DONE)
LOWAS in void fireflies

Primary: Flash redirection
Some pages (6000) have flash handling page advancement, we need to intercept the link somehow and load that page (hard i know, will take some research)
Second option is to diff the flash somehow and do something else when its clicked
Temp solution TODO: Include link to next page
UPDATE: By going to webbroswer based flashes we could intercept the page requst somehow maybe?...

Primary: Openbound solution
Main problem is figuring out where all the configuration xmls are and fixing them so that we can load resources locally


Generic TODO list(no particular order)

-- Download the candy corns and cueballs dynamically as I don't think we should be distributing them
-- Database name as a variable
-- Check if it works with older MSPA works(Jailbreak, problem sleuth), if we're lucky it will jst work with the regular style and we can just lower the minimum page cap
-- Implement archive page
-- Review password saving code
-- Implement ads taken straight from the website in comic footer, legal? (trying to help out hussie here)
(DONE??? I SERIOUSLY CAN'T TELL) -- Figure out how to load Cascade properly (only multipart flash, as of right now I have no idea how it's loading).
-- Support for archival and serial reading modes (x.gif vs x_retcon.gif, activate retcon once past a certain page)
-- Handle pages with inline images such as 4943
-- Better narrative/dialog parsing
-- Support line breaks in pesterlogs
-- Note side by side longways images so the reader doesn't arrange them turnways (*horizontal, *vertical)
(NOT NEEDED?) -- Support fonts via parsing instead of statically
-- Fix pesterlog system message regex?
-- Add funtionality to the header (direct to mspa)
-- Read through and mark down problem pages
-- Fix problem pages
(DONE? lack of integrity check may make it buggy) -- Support Sqlite
-- Support Mysql
-- Better parsing techniques?
(DONE?) -- Support *nix (Theoretically we could as it's .NET, we do have a bunch of native methods however...)
(Dismissed as Impossible) -- S̶u̶p̶p̶o̶r̶t̶ ̶V̶r̶i̶s̶k̶a̶
