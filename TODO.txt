Tasks:

-- LOWAS in void fireflies
-- Fix Linux styles
(DONE) -- Verify the functionality of the go back button
(DONE) -- Make a note that sqlite isn't safe for asynchronous operations on the connection screen (correct me if I'm wrong)
-- Disable Simultaneous Archiving and Reading while in Sqlite mode
-- Download the candy corns and cueballs and green peppers dynamically as I don't think we should be distributing them
-- On that note, find some way to permanently remove the test resources from the repository
-- Database name as a variable
-- Check if it works with older MSPA works(Jailbreak, problem sleuth), if we're lucky it will jst work with the regular style and we can just lower the minimum page cap
-- Implement archive page
-- Review password saving code
-- Implement ads taken straight from the website in comic footer, legal? (trying to help out hussie here, and I'm pretty sure they all go to whatpumpkin anyway)
(DONE??? I SERIOUSLY CAN'T TELL) -- Figure out how to load Cascade properly (only multipart flash, as of right now I have no idea how it's loading).
-- Support for archival and serial reading modes (x.gif vs x_retcon.gif, activate retcon once past a certain page)
-- Better narrative/dialog parsing
-- Support line breaks in pesterlogs
(DONE? Does this happen anywhere besides x2?) -- Note side by side longways images so the reader doesn't arrange them turnways (*horizontal, *vertical)
(NOT NEEDED?) -- Support fonts via parsing instead of statically
-- Fix pesterlog system message regex?
-- Add funtionality to the header (direct to mspa)
-- Read through and mark down problem pages
-- Fix problem pages
(DONE? lack of integrity check may make it buggy, no idea how transactions are handled either) -- Support Sqlite
-- Support Mysql
-- Better parsing techniques?
(DONE? Looks like crap on my box) -- Support *nix (Theoretically we could as it's .NET, we do have a bunch of native methods however...)
(Dismissed as Impossible) -- S̶u̶p̶p̶o̶r̶t̶ ̶V̶r̶i̶s̶k̶a̶
