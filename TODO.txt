Primary: Style sheet support.
Doesn't need to be dynamic, just needs to work

List of known different styles of the top of my head

Regular (DONE)
Scratch
Homosuck
Sbahj
Trickster
2x (not so much a different style as two pages next to each other)
Cascade (Remember to call ScratchPreParse on this page)

Primary: Openbound solution
Main problem is figuring out where all the configuration xmls are and fixing them so that we can load resources locally

Primary: Flash redirection
Some pages (6000) have flash handling page advancement, we need to intercept the link somehow and load that page (hard i know, will take some research)
Second option is to diff the flash somehow and do something else when its clicked

Generic TODO list(no particular order)

-- Figure out how to load Cascade properly (only multipart flash, as of right now I have no idea how it's loading while I'm not connected to the internet, motherfucking miracles? 
It's probably sitting in some cache that I, for the life of me, cannot find)
-- Support for archival and serial reading modes (x.gif vs x_retcon.gif, activate retcon once past a certain page)
-- Handle pages with inline images such as 4943
-- Better narrative/dialog parsing
-- Support line breaks in pesterlogs
-- Note side by side longways images so the reader doesn't arrange them turnways (*horizontal, *vertical)
-- Support fonts via parsing instead of statically
-- Fix pesterlog system message regex
-- Add funtionality to the header (direct to mspa)
-- Read through and mark down problem pages
-- Fix problem pages
-- Support Sqlite
-- Support Mysql
-- Better parsing techniques?
-- Support *nix (Theoretically we could as it's .NET, we do have a bunch of native methods however...)
-- S̶u̶p̶p̶o̶r̶t̶ ̶V̶r̶i̶s̶k̶a̶  Dismissed as Impossible
